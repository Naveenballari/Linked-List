# Linked-List in C
## Introduction
A linked list is a linear data structure used for storing a sequence of elements, where each element is stored in a node that contains both the element and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed. Implementing linked lists in C involves defining structures to represent nodes and implementing operations to manipulate these nodes to create, insert, delete, and traverse the linked list.<br>

## Characteristics
Each node holds a single value and a reference to the next node in the list.<br>
The list has a head, which is a reference to the first node in the list.<br>
The nodes are not stored in a contiguous block of memory, but instead, each node holds the address of the next node in the list.
Accessing elements in a linked list requires traversing the list from the head to the desired node, as there is no direct access to a specific node in memory.<br>

## Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations and each element is connected only to its next element using a pointer.<br>

## Doubly Linked List
A doubly linked list is a special type of linked list in which each node contains a pointer to the previous node as well as the next node in the structure.<br>

## Circular Singly Linked List
A circular linked list is a special type of linked list in which the last node is connected to the first node, creating a continuous loop. In a circular linked list, each node has a reference to the next node in the sequence, just like in a regular linked list, but the last nodeâ€™s reference points back to the first node.<br>
